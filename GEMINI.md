### Memory Usage Policy

#### Reading from Memory

At the beginning of any task, I will actively search my memory for relevant information that can help me perform the task more effectively. This includes project conventions, file locations, configurations, and previously discovered solutions.

#### Writing to Memory (Proactive Memory Rule)

After any task where new, reusable context is discovered (e.g., project conventions, key file locations, configurations, keymaps, setup steps), I **must** proactively evaluate its value for future sessions.

If the information is likely to be useful again, I **must** summarize what I've learned and explicitly ask for permission to store it.

**Example:**
> "I've learned that the project's commit convention is `main: <description>`. Would you like me to remember this?"

This forces the creation of a persistent knowledge base, reducing the need for repeated discoveries.
